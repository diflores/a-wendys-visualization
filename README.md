# An interactive Wendy's Visualization
This example of an interactive visualization originally aimed to show some basic HTML+CSS ([skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)) and dc.js usage to second-year Engineering students who took the course Introduction to Computer Science during the first semester of 2016 at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Later, I used this to show dc.js at [Data Science Day](https://github.com/PUC-SocVis/DataScience-Day1) held at the same university. 

This version is slightly different from what I've presented before. It is now in English and I don't use jQuery anymore.

## Data

I got the Wendy's restaurants information from [here](https://github.com/natashadecoste/JavaGraphing/blob/master/data/wendys.csv).

## Future work

I did this with very little knowledge about good web development practices, so I'd like to make some code refactoring as soon as I got time.

## Preview

You can see the visualization [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/diflores/a-wendys-visualization/blob/master/index.html).
